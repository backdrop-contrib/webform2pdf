Webform2PDF
======================

The Webform2PDF module is an extension of the Webform module that can be used to generate a PDF document from the results of a form submission. The generated PDF document can be attached to the form summary e-mail or downloaded from the Results page.

Different PDF templates can be set for each form. The templates can be formatted with HTML tags, and they can be edited, making the template creation easy and the templates highly customizable. The output documents will be created by using these templates.
